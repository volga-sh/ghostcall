title: aggregateCalls
description: Send a batch and return raw success or failure results.
---

`aggregateCalls()` sends one `eth_call` and returns raw results in call order.
Use it when success flags or revert data are needed, or when selected calls may
fail.

## Usage

```ts
import { aggregateCalls } from "@volga-sh/evm-ghostcall";

const results = await aggregateCalls(client, [
	{
		// WETH totalSupply()
		to: "0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2",
		data: "0x18160ddd",
	},
	{
		to: "0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2",
		data: "0xdeadbeef",
		allowFailure: true,
	},
]);
```

## Signature

```ts
async function aggregateCalls(
	provider: GhostcallProvider,
	calls: readonly GhostcallCall[],
	options?: GhostcallAggregateOptions,
): Promise<GhostcallResult[]>;
```

## Parameters

### provider

```ts
type GhostcallProvider = {
	request(args: { method: string; params?: unknown }): Promise<unknown>;
};
```

A provider with a compatible `request` method, such as a viem client or ox transport.

### calls

```ts
import type { Hex } from "@volga-sh/evm-ghostcall";

type GhostcallCall = {
	to: Hex;
	data: Hex;
	allowFailure?: boolean;
};
```

An ordered list of contract calls. Set `allowFailure: true` when that entry
should be returned with `success: false` instead of throwing an error.

`allowFailure` controls SDK behavior after the response arrives. It is not part
of the bytes sent to the EVM.

### options

```ts
type GhostcallAggregateOptions = {
	maxInitcodeBytes?: number;
	ethCall?: {
		from?: Hex;
		gas?: bigint;
		blockTag?: bigint | "latest" | "earliest" | "pending" | "safe" | "finalized";
	};
};
```

`blockTag` takes a block number or a named tag and defaults to `"latest"`. Block
numbers and `gas` are sent as RPC hex quantities. `maxInitcodeBytes` defaults to
`49,152`.

## Returns

```ts
type GhostcallResult = { success: boolean; returnData: Hex };
```

The promise resolves to one result per call, in the same order.

## Throws

- `TypeError` for invalid addresses, hex data, options, or provider responses.
- `RangeError` when one call or the full request exceeds its size limit.
- [`GhostcallSubcallError`](/api/subcall-error/) when a call fails without
  `allowFailure: true`.
- `Error` when the response contains a different number of results than the
  request.

Provider and transport errors pass through unchanged.

Use [`aggregateDecodedCalls()`](/api/aggregate-decoded-calls/) when every call
must succeed and decoded values are needed.
